## Installation
In order to use this project, the user must have Node.js and MySQL installed on their local machine.

To clone the repository to the local machine, type `git clone git@github.com:kaylab78/ecommerce-backend.git` in the command line interface.

This project requires dotenv, Express.js, MySQL2 and Sequelize. First use `npm init -y` to initialize. Then use `npm install` to install the required packages.

## Usage
To create the schema in the MySQL shell, use the following commands:
```
mysql -u root -p
// You'll be prompted to enter your password
mysql> source db/schema.sql
```

To seed the data in the database, navigate to the CLI and type `npm run seed`.

To start the server and test the API routes, type `node server` or `npm start` in the CLI.

Once the server has started, navigate to Insomnia. Test the following routes.

Category:
- Use a GET route with [http://localhost:3001/api/categories](http://localhost:3001/api/categories) to get all of the categories in the database.
- Use a GET route with an ID to get just one category. Example: [http://localhost:3001/api/categories/1](http://localhost:3001/api/categories/1)
- Use a POST route to create a new category. Use [http://localhost:3001/api/categories](http://localhost:3001/api/categories) with JSON in the body. Example: `{ "category_name" : "Swimwsuits" }`
- Use a PUT route to update a category using the category ID. Example: [http://localhost:3001/api/categories/6](http://localhost:3001/api/categories/6) with JSON body `{ "category_name" : "Swimwear" }`
- Use a DELETE route to delete a category using the ID. Example: [http://localhost:3001/api/categories/6](http://localhost:3001/api/categories/6)

## Credits
Starter code cloned from Xander Rapstine at [https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/fantastic-umbrella](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/fantastic-umbrella).

Meg Meyers, boot camp tutor, assisted me with the POST and PUT routes for Product. She discovered that there was a line of code missing from the starter code that made Insomnia return a 400 error when I tried to test the PUT route.
